## Assembly, Installation, and Scale Configuration
The Printed Precision Trickler has been designed for quick and easy user assembly, with the complete first-time setup taking 5 minutes or less for most users. No module require the use of tools for assembly, but a small amount of super glue or a similar cyanoacrylate glue is recommended for the Base Module.
### Scale Tray Installation
1. Remove the factory scale weighing tray from your A&D balance, or whatever other weighing tray may currently be installed, and ensure the top of the scale is free of any loose powder kernels or other debris
2. Place the Printed Precision Trickler's Scale Tray into the hole in the center on top of the A&D balance
   - NOTE: The Scale Tray is keyed and can be oriented in 4 different positions - the opening of the Tray Centering Ring on the top of the tray should face towards the front-right corner of the scale
### Base Module
1. Orient the Trickle/Bulk Module Mount such that the small funnel is pointing up and the two square cutouts are angling away from the opening in the Stand With Integrated Windbreak
   - ***(OPTIONAL)*** Apply a small amount of super glue or other CA glue to the top edge of the Stand, but not to the tips of the 3 "fingers" that protrude from the top edge ***(OPTIONAL)***
2. Ensuring the 3 protruding fingers on the top of the Stand line up with the 3 cutouts in the bottom of the Module Mount, place the Module Mount down onto the top of the Stand
3. Once aligned, press firmly to ensure that the Module Mount is fully-seated and level with the top of the Stand
   - If CA glue was applied to the top of the Stand, hold the Module Mount in position for 15-45 seconds until the glue sets
4. Place the Base Module onto your scale within the raised ring, such that the windbreak opening is facing the front-right corner of the scale
   - The two tabs on the ring at the base will fit into the openings on the left and right of the raised ring on top of the scale
### Trickle Dispense Module
1. Select which Trickler Disk you would like to use
   - The Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Varget") is ideal for most non-magnum rifle powders and is the recommended starting point when utilizing the Printed Precision Trickler with any new powder you have not used before
   - The Large Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Retubbo") is ideal and necessary for some magnum rifle powders, such as Retumbo and N570, with exceptionally large kernels that do not fit into the slots of the Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk
2. Hold the Trickler Disk within the top portion of the Trickler Cup, oriented so that the flat surface of the disk is facing down
3. Rotate the Trickler Disk until the flat edge within the center through-hole lines up with the flat surface on the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
4. Grasping the center knob, press the Trickler Disk down onto the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
5. Release the center knob, and press down on the flat top surface of the disk using your thumbs on opposite sides of the center knob (as close to the middle as possible) to ensure that the Trickler Disk has been fully inserted
### Bulk Dispense Module
1. Install the Bulk Disk using the same technique as installation of a trickler disk, first lining up the keyed motor shaft with the through-hole on the disk before pressing it into place using the center knob and your thumbs on opposite sides of the flat top surface
2. Rotate the Bulk Cup until the larger opening in the sidewall is facing towards you
3. Place the Bulk Hopper on top of the disk, with the hopper portion away from you and pointing up. The bar extending from the bottom of the hopper will protrude through the opening in the Bulk Cup side wall towards you at this point in time
4. Line up the tab on the far side of the Bulk Hopper with the small hole in the far sidewall of the Bulk Cup, and press firmly to insert the tab into the hole
5. Once the far tab has been inserted, keep forwards pressure while sliding the near-side tab to your right into the horizontal slot in the Bulk Cup sidewall
6. Once both tabs have been inserted into their respective slots, pull the hopper back towards you slightly to ensure it is firmly pressed against the surface of the Bulk Cup's sidewall near the large opening
7. If the red rubber Hopper Gasket is not positioned within the retaining groove at the top of the installed Bulk Hopper, replace it back into the top groove at this time
### Final Assembly
1. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Trickle Dispense Module into the left square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Trickler Module has a hole in the bottom near the edge that kernels will drop through, this hole must face the center funnel of the Module Mount
2. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Bulk Dispense Module into the right square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Bulk Dispense Module has a tighter fit than the Trickle Dispense Module due to the additional weight of a full powder hopper
3. Insert the Powder Hopper into the top of the Bulk Hopper, where it will have a snug fit inside of the Hopper Gasket, until it reaches a hard stop and can be inserted no further
4. Place the Powder Hopper Cap over the top of the Powder Hopper
