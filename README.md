## Assembly, Installation, and Scale Configuration
The Printed Precision Trickler has been designed for quick and easy user assembly, with the complete first-time setup taking 5 minutes or less for most users. No module require the use of tools for assembly, but a small amount of super glue or a similar cyanoacrylate glue is recommended for the Base Module.
### Scale Tray Installation
1. Remove the factory scale weighing tray from your A&D balance, or whatever other weighing tray may currently be installed, and ensure the top of the scale is free of any loose powder kernels or other debris
2. Place the Printed Precision Trickler's Scale Tray into the hole in the center on top of the A&D balance
   - NOTE: The Scale Tray is keyed and can be oriented in 4 different positions - the opening of the Tray Centering Ring on the top of the tray should face towards the front-right corner of the scale
### Base Module
1. Orient the Trickle/Bulk Module Mount such that the small funnel is pointing up and the two square cutouts are angling away from the opening in the Stand With Integrated Windbreak
   - ***(OPTIONAL)*** Apply a small amount of super glue or other CA glue to the top edge of the Stand, but not to the tips of the 3 "fingers" that protrude from the top edge ***(OPTIONAL)***
2. Ensuring the 3 protruding fingers on the top of the Stand line up with the 3 cutouts in the bottom of the Module Mount, place the Module Mount down onto the top of the Stand
3. Once aligned, press firmly to ensure that the Module Mount is fully-seated and level with the top of the Stand
   - If CA glue was applied to the top of the Stand, hold the Module Mount in position for 15-45 seconds until the glue sets
4. Place the Base Module onto your scale within the raised ring, such that the windbreak opening is facing the front-right corner of the scale
   - The two tabs on the ring at the base will fit into the openings on the left and right of the raised ring on top of the scale
### Trickle Dispense Module
1. Select which Trickler Disk you would like to use
   - The Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Varget") is ideal for most non-magnum rifle powders and is the recommended starting point when utilizing the Printed Precision Trickler with any new powder you have not used before
   - The Large Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Retubbo") is ideal and necessary for some magnum rifle powders, such as Retumbo and N570, with exceptionally large kernels that do not fit into the slots of the Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk
2. Hold the Trickler Disk within the top portion of the Trickler Cup, oriented so that the flat surface of the disk is facing down
3. Rotate the Trickler Disk until the flat edge within the center through-hole lines up with the flat surface on the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
4. Grasping the center knob, press the Trickler Disk down onto the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
5. Release the center knob, and press down on the flat top surface of the disk using your thumbs on opposite sides of the center knob (as close to the middle as possible) to ensure that the Trickler Disk has been fully inserted
### Bulk Dispense Module
1. Install the Bulk Disk using the same technique as installation of a trickler disk, first lining up the keyed motor shaft with the through-hole on the disk before pressing it into place using the center knob and your thumbs on opposite sides of the flat top surface
2. Rotate the Bulk Cup until the larger opening in the sidewall is facing towards you
3. Place the Bulk Funnel on top of the disk, with the hopper portion away from you and pointing up. The bar extending from the bottom of the hopper will protrude through the opening in the Bulk Cup side wall towards you at this point in time
4. Line up the tab on the far side of the Bulk Funnel with the small hole in the far sidewall of the Bulk Cup, and press firmly to insert the tab into the hole
5. Once the far tab has been inserted, keep forwards pressure while sliding the near-side tab to your right into the horizontal slot in the Bulk Cup sidewall
6. Once both tabs have been inserted into their respective slots, pull the hopper back towards you slightly to ensure it is firmly pressed against the surface of the Bulk Cup's sidewall near the large opening
7. If the red rubber Hopper Gasket is not positioned within the retaining groove at the top of the installed Bulk Funnel, replace it back into the top groove at this time
### Final Assembly
1. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Trickle Dispense Module into the left square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Trickler Module has a hole in the bottom near the edge that kernels will drop through, this hole must face the center funnel of the Module Mount
2. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Bulk Dispense Module into the right square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Bulk Dispense Module has a tighter fit than the Trickle Dispense Module due to the additional weight of a full powder hopper
3. Insert the Powder Hopper into the top of the Bulk Funnel, where it will have a snug fit inside of the Hopper Gasket, until it reaches a hard stop and can be inserted no further
4. Place the Powder Hopper Cap over the top of the Powder Hopper
### Plugging Everything In
1. Plug the end of the Bulk cable into the motor of your Bulk Dispense Module
   - The connector may only be inserted in one direction, with the alignment tabs facing up
2. Plug the end of the Trickle cable into the motor of your Trickle Dispense Module
3. Plug one end of the provided RS-232 cable into the matching port on the right side of your trickler Control Unit as well as the rear of your fx-series scale
4. Plug the included power adapter into both the wall and the barrel jack on the right side of your trickler Control Unit
   - ***CAUTION*** To avoid spilled powder from the startup calibration cycle, ensure that a cup is placed on the weighing plate PRIOR to powering the Printed Precision Trickler
5. Plug the power adapter into both the wall and the scale, only after first ensuring that a cup is been placed on the weighing plate
   - It is ***STRONGLY RECOMENDED*** that you have a cup sitting on the weighing plate when power is first provided to the scale, as this helps to prevent powder from being dispensed without a cup present to collect it during normal operation
## Scale Configuration
Settings that require configuration and the configured values:
- bA5Fnc-Cond = 0

### Detailed Scale Programming Instructions
For those who have a standard/unlocked fx-series scale, denoted by the presence of an orange "Re-Zero" key on the front panel of the scale, the following steps are all that is needed to program your scale for use with the Printed Precision Trickler. For those with an NTEP scale, denoted by model names ending with "N" and an orange "Tare" key on the front panel, you must first follow steps further below to unlock your scale so that the configuration may be altered.

1. User action --> Display after action is completed

The format of these instructions are as noted above, where the action you need to take is immediately followed by what you should see on the display once the action has been completed.

1. Press and hold SAMPLE for 2 seconds --> bA5Fnc
2. Press PRINT --> Cond
3. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 2 times, or until 0 is displayed --> Cond 0
4. Press SAMPLE 4 times --> 5Pd

    - If GN does not appear as an option when cycling through all individual settings, exit the configuration menu by pressing CAL, turn the scale off, and proceed to the Konami Code Unit Selection instructions below
22. Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit GN (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grains has been selected as your default unit of measurement)
23. Press PRINT --> id
24. Press CAL --> Exits configuration menu

Your scale should now be fully configured to operate with your Printed Precision Trickler!

### Konami Code Unit Selection
Unfortunately some scales will arrive without having Grains available to select as your unit of measure, which is usually the result of the scale being an NTEP model rather than a factory unlocked scale. This requires a more complicated method to enable Grains as an option before it may be selected in the standard configuration menu as described above.

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** - Step 4 has a very short window of time in which it must be completed, so please make sure to read steps 3-5 in full prior to completing step 3 to avoid needing to restart the process

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Read steps 3-5 to be sure you understand them prior to continuing
3. Hold PRINT and RE-ZERO/TARE while turning the scale on --> The screen will light up
4. ***While still holding RE-ZERO/TARE***, release the PRINT key and then rapidly press PRINT 2 times --> The screen will go empty
5. Hold RE-ZERO/TARE and press PRINT --> Unit g
   - If you don't see unit after pressing PRINT the first time, press PRINT a 2nd time because some scales (depending on exact factory configuration) will require 2 presses of it to proceed here
6. Press SAMPLE until GN is displayed --> Unit GN
7. Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit GN (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grains has been enabled as a unit of measurement)
8. ***OPTIONAL*** Press SAMPLE until g is displayed --> Unit g
9. ***OPTIONAL*** Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit g (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grams has been enabled as a unit of measurement)
10. Press PRINT --> END will display, followed by another menu item (exact menu item depends on the individual scale)
11. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the Detailed Scale Programming Instructions above

### NTEP Scale Unlocking
For people with NTEP scales, denoting by model names ending with "N" and an orange "Tare" key on the front panel instead of the orange "RE-ZERO" key that unlocked models have, the following steps must be taken BEFORE you can properly configure your scale to work with the Printed Precision Trickler.

NOTE: Your NTEP scale may also have arrived to you with a metal plate attached to the back of the outer housing, directly underneath the RS-232 port. To be able to press the "Internal Cal" button in these instructions you must first remove this plate as it covers the opening through which that button is accessed.

***Internal Cal*** -- This button is located within the outer housing of the scale, accessed by reaching through the hole below the RS-232 port in the back of the housing. It is along the rear edge of the scale housing at the very top, and can usually be felt simply by inserting a finger into the opening and bending your knuckle until you feel the circuit board mounted to the top of the housing.

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Press and hold both Internal Cal and CAL buttons while turning the scale on --> The entire display will light up at once (you can release the Internal Cal and CAL buttons once you see this)
3. Hold SAMPLE and press PRINT 2 times --> APr
   - If you see something other than APr, press SAMPLE until APr is displayed
   - If APr is not available when cycling through all menu options with the SAMPLE key, turn the scale off and follow Advanced NTEP Unlock instructions further below
4. Press PRINT --> APr
5. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> APr 0 (STD will display above APr)
6. Press PRINT --> End will display
7. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the Konami Code Unit Selection instructions above

### Advanced NTEP Unlock
Due to the large number of possible configurations for an fx-series scale from the factory, you may find yourself unfortunately stymied when trying to locate the APr menu to unlock your NTEP scale. Don't worry, this doesn't mean your scale is broken or unusable! It simply means your scale's default configuration is slightly different from most NTEP scales and requires an extra step to enable the APr menu from the NTEP Scale Unlocking instructions.

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Press and hold both Internal Cal and CAL buttons while turning the scale on --> The entire display will light up at once (you can release the Internal Cal and CAL buttons once you see this)
3. Hold TARE and press PRINT --> Unit
4. Press SAMPLE until Ld is displayed --> Ld
5. Press PRINT --> Ld # (# will be some number, it varies from scale to scale)
6. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> Ld 0
7. Press PRINT --> End will display, followed by another menu item (exact menu item depends on the individual scale)
   - If Ani is displayed, skip step 8
8. Press SAMPLE until Ani is displayed --> Ani
9. Press PRINT --> Ani # (# will be some number, it varies from scale to scale)
10. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> Ani 0
11. Press PRINT --> End will display, followed by another menu item
12. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the NTEP Scale Unlocking instructions above

## Operating Instructions
The Printed Precision Trickler has been designed to allow anyone to quickly and easily dispense accurate powder charges without needing to download and pair a companion app or navigate complex menus for configuration. To achieve this goal, your trickler's Control Unit has the following important items:

### Trickler Disk Selection
The selection of which disk to use in your Printed Precision Trickler is an important one, but fortunately it's also easy to make. Past examples of disk tricklers transported kernels laying down on their side, making the proper fitment sensitive to both kernel length and kernel diameter. 
Due to the Printed Precision Trickler's innovative design that instead carries kernels upright on end within the slots of a disk, the only factor in determining the proper disk for your powder in this system is the extrusion diameter of the kernels.

Most fast to moderate burn rate powders will utilize the disk marked "Varget", optimized for powders with kernel diameters of 0.7-1.0mm (0.026-0.039"). The "Retubbo" disk was created for use with larger diameter powders, such as those commonly used in magnum rifle cartridges, with kernel diameters of 1.1mm or greater.

### Powder Fill Levels
The Trickler Cup in your Printed Precision Trickler should not be overfilled. A good starting point is to place approximately 50-75 grains of powder in the trickler cup and occasionally add to that quantity whenever you observe the pile of extra powder at the low end of the cup running low. 
While the Trickler Cup can hold more than 75gr of powder at time, 75gr is a safe starting point as the exact maximum depends on the specific powder in use. The Trickler Cup is overfilled when the pile of powder from the low end of the cup travels all the way around the disk and begins to spill over the top edge of the disk through the opening in the cup. This is easily recognized by the excessively high calibrated kernel weights and more frequent overthrows this condition can cause.

The Bulk Hopper may be filled as full as you like, or left as empty as you please so long as there is enough powder to at least fill the very bottom of the Bulk Funnel. You may use the Printed Precision Trickler with replacement hoppers that fit within the Bulk Funnel or even with no hopper at all if you so desire.

### Emptying After User
The Bulk Hopper is emptied by first lifting the entire Bulk Dispense Module straight up, removing it from the mount it sits in, and then angling the assembly towards the opening in the cup wall that it dispenses through in normal operation. The powder will flow across the disk and out the opening into whatever recepticle you aim the opening towards. 

The Trickler Cup may be emptied in two different ways, but both similarly begin by removing the Trickle Dispense Module from the mount it sits in. You can then either tip the module towards the taller rim of the cup and pour the powder out the top, or you may tip the module towards the lower rim of the cup and pour the powder out the bottom of the cup as it bypasses the trickler disk. In either case, after you have poured all of the loose powder from the Trickler Cup it is recommended to manually rotate the disk (with a container underneath the hole it dispenses from in normal operation) to remove any kernels that may still remain in the slots of the disk.

### Indicator Lights
The three lights across the top of your Control Unit will give you important information about the current status of the Printed Precision Trickler. 

The red light on the left is used to indicate that the dispensed charge is outside the acceptable error range (more on that in a moment), or that there was some error in calibration. This is the most important light of the three, because when it is lit you should check the display to see what is wrong
The yellow light in the middle is used to indicate that a charge has not yet finished dispensing, or it is used after a charge is dispensed if the reading from the scale has changed to be lower than the targeted charge weight. When illuminated after a charge finished dispensing you have the option to either discard the charge and start fresh if you are concerned with the possibility of scale drift, or you may manually dispense additional kernels one at a time to reach the targeted charge weight.
The green light on the right is used to indicate that calibration was successful or that a charge was dispensed within the acceptable error range. This is the light you'll see most often and it tells you that your charge has been accurately dispensed to within the weight of a single kernel.

### Front Panel Buttons
The Control Unit has 3 different buttons on its front panel, directly underneath the display. The ones on the left and right are standard buttons that release when you stop pushing them, but the middle item is a toggle switch that serves to enable and disable the dispensing of powder during use. 
The middle switch will depress slightly and light up with a blue ring around the center button when it is enabled, and the light will turn off when it is released and disabled. While this middle switch is enabled, the left and right buttons won't change anything to prevent any accidental adjustments in the middle of a loading session.
When the middle switch is disabled, you may use the left button to decrease the targeted charge weight or the right button to increase the target weight. Pressing and holding either button will continuously increment/decrement the target weight, and the longer you hold the faster it will adjust. It starts out as 0.02gr increments, stepping up to 0.1gr and later full 1gr increments to make even large adjustments in target weight fast and easy.
If you ever notice unusual behavior the left and right buttons can also be used to request recalibration of the Bulk and Trickle dispensers. Simply press and hold both left and right buttons at the same time for at least 1 second and the trickler will go into Calibration mode.

### Display
While the indicator lights are handy for information at a glance while dispensing, the display on the front of the Control Unit will provide you with additional details about the configuration and current status of the Printed Precision Trickler. Throughout use this display will show you one of 5 distinct states:

#### Initialization
When you first plug the power adapter into the Control Unit it will perform initialization and attempt to establish a connection with your scale. The scale must be powered by its own separate power adapter for this, but it doesn't have to be turned on yet. The display will notify you during this time if a scale connection cannot be established.

#### Calibration
After a connection is established, the trickler will proceed to initial calibration and you will be prompted by the display to press the enable toggle to begin. Make sure you have powder in the bulk hopper/trickler cup when doing this, as well as an empty cup in place to catch dispensed kernels! It will run both the bulk and trickler motors to measure how fast the Bulk Module is dispensing and the kernel weight of your currently-loaded powder.
This is the same state you will enter if you press and hold the left and right buttons to re-calibrate the unit.

At the end of the calibration process the display will show your current calibrated kernel weight, as well as the acceptable error margin for dispensed charges. You should dump the powder dispensed into the cup during calibration back into the bulk hopper and/or the trickler cup at this time, and the display will prompt you to release/disable the middle toggle switch to proceed.

This error margin is automatically calculated based on the measured kernel weight to ensure that any time you see a green light your dispensed charge is accurate to within a single kernel of the targeted charge weight.
For example, if you have a kernel weight of ~0.021gr (common for powders with moderate burn-rate such as Varget or H4350) the acceptable error margin will be 0.02gr because single kernel accuracy will always give you either your exact targeted charge weight or 0.02gr over depending on the exact weight of the last individual kernel and how the scale's rounding accumulates across multiple dispensed kernels. 
This is because 9 kernels each weighing exactly 0.021gr (actual weight - 0.189gr) would register as a weight of 0.18gr on an fx-series scale, while 10 of the same 0.021gr kernels (actual weight - 0.210gr) would be rounded up to 0.22 grains by the scale.

For larger powders, such as Retumbo or N570, the weight of each kernel may exceed 0.04gr which would lead to the acceptable error margin being set to 0.04gr instead. This maintains the same single-kernel level of precision as the 0.02gr error example above, just with increased weight for that single kernel. 
The Printed Precision Trickler supports a maximum acceptable error margin of 0.06gr, though this should be extremely rare as you would be hard pressed to find a powder with kernels that each weigh more than 0.06gr on average.

#### Idle
Once calibration has finished and the middle toggle button is released/disabled, you'll find yourself in the Idle state. This is where you can adjust the targeted charge weight with the left/right buttons or press and hold both buttons to request re-calibration of the system.
The display will show you your current target weight and acceptable error margin as well as the current software version.

The idle state may also be reached at any time by releasing/disabling the middle toggle button. Returning to the idle state in this fashion will immediately halt both the bulk and trickle motors, allowing it to serve double-duty as a panic button in case a misplaced cup is spilling kernels or for any other reason.

#### Ready
When the middle toggle switch has been depressed/enabled from the Idle state, you will enter the Ready state. At this point the system will be ready for you to place an empty cup on the weighing plate so that it may begin dispensing charges. 

When placing an empty cup on the weighing plate, be sure to slide it into the center until it hits the weighing plate's retaining ring and stops. This will ensure that your powder cup is always placed in the same spot, centered within the weighing plate, to avoid potential error in the accuracy of dispensed charges.

***NOTE*** Do not depress/enable the middle toggle switch without a cup on the weighing plate. If the scale reads a weight of less than 1gr away from the scale's zero value without the cup in place the system may dispense powder without a means of containing it, with will spill out within the draft shield and onto your loading bench. 
This problematic condition can also be avoided by following the assembly steps above to ensure that a cup is sitting on the weighing plate when you first plug in the scale's power adapter, as this will cause the empty weighing plate to read a weight of -E which prohibits powder from being dispensed

If your scale does not read zero when you place an empty cup on the weighing plate, don't worry! This can happen for a variety of reasons, but is most commonly due to not having the cup on the weighing plate when the scale was first turned on or from the scale last being zeroed with some powder still inside of the weighing cup. Simply place the empty cup you wish to use on the weighing plate and press the orange RE-ZERO/TARE key to begin dispensing powder.

#### Dispense
Once the scale reads a weight of +/- 1gr, to account for slight amounts of scale zero drift that occur during extended breaks between loading sessions if the scale is left on, the Printed Precision Trickler will begin dispensing your targeted powder charge in a two-stage operation. 
When the trickler begins to dispense the yellow light on top will illuminate to indicate that a charge is currently in-progress, and the display will update to indicate whether it is currently utilizing the Bulk Dispense Module or Trickle Dispense Module.

It will first re-zero the scale. This gives you the flexibility to use two different powder cups with very similar but not quite identical weights without issue. It also combats the potential for scale drift over long loading sessions to affect the accuracy of dispensed charges.

Then the Bulk Dispense Module will rapidly measure out the majority of the charge. The first pulse of the Bulk Module will attempt to dispense roughly 95% of the target weight, and if more than 1gr remains to dispense after the first pulse a second smaller pulse from the Bulk Module will serve to further close the gap to the target weight.

After these two Bulk Module operations, or if the current weight is within 1gr of the target after the first pulse, the Printed Precision Trickler will switch to instead utilize the Trickle Dispense Module. The precise nubmer of kernels to dispense will be calculated based on the calibrated weight of a single kernel and then rapidly dispensed.
If lighter than average kernels were dispensed in this first trickle operation the process of calculation and dispensing will repeat until the target weight has been achieved. 

The Printed Precision Trickler software will also continuously refine the calibration variables for both the Bulk Dispense Module and Trickle Dispense Module throughout your loading session to ensure optimal speed and precision. 
The main bulk pulse and secondary bulk pulse each have their own calibration factor that will be adjusted if dispensed totals do not fall within the expected range, serving to fine-tune the results of the initial calibration process. The calibrated kernel weight will also be refined based on the performance of the first trickle operation to reduce or eliminate the need for additional trickle operations in the future.
Optimal accuracy of these calibration variables should be reached within 10-20 dispensed charges with a noticeable effect on the time required to dispense each charge, but successful dispenses will have single kernel accuracy from the very first charge thrown.

#### Evaluate
After the measured charge weight has reached or exceeded the target weight, the Printed Precision Trickler will advance to the Evaluate state. The display will show the target weight, dispensed weight, acceptable error margin, and the time spent dispensing the last charge (in milliseconds).

If the charge is accurate to within the acceptable error margin, the green light will illuminate to indicate a successful charge accurate to within a single kernel. This allows you to determine at a glance if a dispensed charge is known to be accurate within a single kernel.

If the charge has exceeded the acceptable error margin, the red light will illuminate and the display with give an overthrow warning. If you are satisfied with the accuracy of the charge (a charge dispensed to 0.04gr over target when the acceptable error margin was set to 0.02gr, for example) you may elect to still use it, but if you wish to maintain single kernel accuracy it is recommended that you dump the overweight dispensed charge back into either the Bulk Hopper or Trickler Cup.

If initial evaluation determines that a charge was dispensed successfully, the Printed Precision Trickler will continue to monitor the scale reading to ensure that it does not observe a change in the reported charge weight prior to the powder cup being removed from the weighing plate. If the scale reading increases and exceeds the acceptable error margin, due to a longer than expected settling time for example, the trickler will immediately notify you by turning off the 
green light and instead providing the red indicator light with an overthrow warning display. 

If the scale reading instead decreases to below the target value after the initial evaluation, the green light will be exchanged for a yellow indicator light and the trickler will provide you with the option to manually add one kernel at a time if you so desire. This can be helpful if vibration or air drafts lead to a scale reading that is slightly higher than the actual amount of powder in the cup, allowing you to quickly add the final kernel or two to correct for this environmental disturbance during the dispense.

Once you lift the cup off the weighing plate it will automatically return the trickler to the Ready state, awaiting the placement of an empty cup to begin dispensing the next charge all over again. 

## Troubleshooting
Tips and tricks for optimal operation

### Static Electricity
The main problem encountered by users of the Printed Precision Trickler is that of static electricity. This can cause kernels of powder to cling to the hopper, the disks, the cups containing the disks, or the funnel integrated into the mounts on top of the draft shield. If kernels cling to these parts it can reduce the precision of dispensed charges since the trickler can no longer fully control the number of kernels that are dispensed into the powder cup. Take care to avoid static in your reloading area by touching something metallic to discharge yourself prior to handling or using the Printed Precision Trickler if your home or shop is prone to static electricity. 

When your trickler is brand new, the parts may have a static charge that accumulated during shipping and transport. The most effective and convenient method of removing any charge that may accumulate in transit, as well as preventing future static cling, is with the application of a dry graphite lubricant available in a spray application. You may also apply a small amount of graphite powder at any time to parts of the trickler using a brush or your finger as a highly-effective means of removing static charge and preventing future accumulation, though this can be much messier than the spray application and is best performed outdoors. Another highly convenient alternative is to rub all of the parts (except for the interior of the powder cup) with a dryer sheet, new or used. 

While the friction surfaces of your trickler have been treated at the time of manufacturing to help prevent accumulation of static charge in normal operation, you may notice some amount of static cling during the first few loading sessions using it - particularly operating in arid environments. If you notice static cling during normal operation, feel free to re-apply graphite spray/powder or the dryer sheet treatment though this should resolve itself soon after you begin using your trickler. As you use your Printed Precision Trickler small amounts of the graphite used to coat the kernels of gunpowder will rub off onto the parts of the trickler that come into contact with powder. This may cause some discoloration of parts, but it is not harmfull and serves the same beneficial purposes as the initial surface treatment during manufacturing and any post-purchase application of graphite or dryer sheets. 

Static electricity can also interfere with the ability of your fx-series scale to accurately and realibly measure the load on the weighing plate. If you notice unusually large drift in your scale readings or zero of 0.1gr or more within a timeframe of less than an hour, the most likely culprit is an accumulated static charge on some part of your trickler. The largest effect can be observed in this fashion if the base/draft shield or weighing plate has accumulated a charge. While these parts, like the friction surface, are treated during manufacturing to help prevent the accumulation of static charge this is always a good first step to troubleshoot scale drift prior to investing in expensive power conditioners under the assumption it is caused by a "dirty" input power from the wall. 

### Scale Drift
As mentioned above, the most likely culprit of unusually large drift in your scale readings/zero is an accumulated static charge near the sensitive electronics of the scale. Smaller amounts of drift and scale readings that appear bouncy or jittery usually have different root causes, however.

It is recommended to not utilize flourescent lighting in your loading area as it can both remotely affect the operation of your fx-series scale and lead to a "dirtier" power supply if the lights are powered on the same circuit as your scale. This is a common culprit behind smaller quantities (<0.1gr) of drift in your scale readings.

Similarly it is recommended that you attempt to isolate your scale from both vibration and air drafts during normal operation. This is the most common cause of scale readings that appear bouncy or jittery. The draft shield integrated into the Printed Precision Trickler, combined with the smaller surface area of the provided weighing plate, give an improved level of resilience against air drafts but you should still place it somewhere away from the path of airflow from HVAC vents, open windows/doors, or heavy foot traffic. For vibration isolations a sturdy surface to place the scale upon is a must, and ideally this surface would not be the same as the one your reloading press is mounted to. Since this isn't always practically feasible, another highly effective method of isolating the scale from other activity on your solid work surface is to place it upon a granite surface plate heavy concrete paver. This can be combined with vibration-dampening feet for optimal isolation performance, though simply sitting on the heavy mass without additional dampers can also go a long way in reducing the impact of vibrations on your scale readings.

## Software Updates
To update the software on your Printed Precision Trickler, you will need the following items:
- Windows, MacOS, or Linux computer
- MicroUSB cable

The steps below will be provided from the perspective of a user with a computer running the Windows operating system, but the steps are largely similar across all operating systems.

### Install Arduino IDE and the Arduino AVR Board Package
Those who have used an Arduino before in the past may already have these steps completed, but for those new to Arduinos here are the steps to follow on a Windows computer:
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino website here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
   - You may select whatever options you like during the installation procedure, it will not affect your ability to update the software on your trickler
2. Launch the newly-installed program
3. In the far-left column of the Arduino IDE, select the icon that is 2nd from the top named "Board Manager"
4. Search for or scroll to locate the "Arduino AVR Boards" item in the list of options, and click "INSTALL"
   - You may see a prompt requesting permission to make changes, this is to install the drivers that will allow your computer to communicate with the Arduino Nano

### Download, Extract, and Open the Latest Printed Precision Trickler Software Release
1. On the GitHub page where this user manual is located (https://github.com/PrintedPrecision/Printed-Precision-Trickler), click the "Releases" text on the right-hand side of the screen to show all software releases
   - Alternatively, you may click the release tag name immediately below the "Releases" text to navigate directly to the latest release
2. Locate the software release version you wish to install and click one of the options below the description to download a compressed archive of the source code for that software release
   - For those using Windows PC's, the zip version is highly recommended
3. Open the file explorer and navigate to your downloads folder where the compressed archive is saved
4. Extract the source code from the compressed archive
   - Note that the location you extract the files to is unimportant
5. Once the compressed archive has finished extracting, navigate into the folders until you see a list of 10 files - inclduding this User Manual!
6. In the folder where all 10 files are visible, create a new folder named "PrintedPrecisionTrickler"
   - Arduino IDE requires that the main project file (the one with the .ino file extension) be located within a folder of the same name as the project file
7. Drag and drop all 10 of the files into your newly created folder, before entering this folder to once again view the full list of 10 files
8. Double-click the file named "PrintedPrecisionTrickler.ino" to open the project file in your installed Arduino IDE

### Install the Additional Libraries
1. In the far-left column of the Arduino IDE, select the icon that is 3rd from the top named "Library Manager"
2. Type "MobaTools" into the search bar and locate the library of the same name in the list of results published by "MicroBahner" - click "INSTALL"
   - This is the library to control the stepper motors, with the latest version being 2.6.2 at the time of this writing
   - You will notice that the description for this library is written in German, but don't worry! You will not need to know any foreign languages to complete your software update.
3. Type "hd44780" into the search bar and locate the library of the same name in the list of results published by "Bill Perry" - click "INSTALL"
   - This is the library to control the display, with the latest version being 1.3.2 at the time of this writing

### Connect Your Trickler and Update the Software
Now that all of our preparations are complete, we are finally ready to update the software on your Printed Precision Trickler!
1. Disconnect your Printed Precision Trickler from both your scale and the power supply that was included with your trickler
2. Plug one end of your MicroUSB cable to an available USB port on your computer
3. Plug the other end of your MicroUSB cable into the port located within the opening on the left side panel of your trickler control unit
   - Note that this only plugs in one direction! The widest edge of the MicroUSB's trapezoidal shape should face up.
   - Your computer may prompt you for permission to install a device driver at this point, click to allow this driver to be installed if this happens for you
4. In the top left corner of the Arduino IDE you will see a drop down selection menu, click on this and then click on the option named "Arduino Nano Every"
   - Underneath the "Arduino Nano Every" descripter will be a "COM5" or similar phrase, this is normal and just indicates the name of the port your Arduino is plugged into and is not important (it will be different for different computers)
5. Locate the Upload button to the left of this drop-down menu
   - It looks like an arrow pointing sideways, and is the 2nd icon from the left in the top tray that also contains the Verify button (a checkmark) and the Arduino selection drop-down menu
6. Click the Upload button to update the software of your trickler
   - This process will take approximately 10-15 seconds
   - You will see a progress menu in the bottom right corner - ***DO NOT UNPLUG THE MICRO USB CABLE UNTIL AFTER IT CHANGES TO SAY "DONE UPLOADING"***
   - You will likely see red error text pop up in the "Output" window on the lower half of the screen, this is expected and does not cause any issues (you can read more about this on the [Arduino support website](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4405239282578-If-you-see-a-jtagmkII-initialize-Cannot-locate-flash-and-boot-memories-in-description-message-when-uploading-to-Nano-Every) if you would like)

At this point the software on your Printed Precision Trickler has been updated! You may confirm that your trickler software has been updated by making sure that the version number displayed on the screen is the same as the release version that you downloaded, and you may freely disconnect the MicroUSB cable at this time.
