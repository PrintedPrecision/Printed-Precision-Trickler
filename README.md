## Assembly, Installation, and Scale Configuration
The Printed Precision Trickler has been designed for quick and easy user assembly, with the complete first-time setup taking 5 minutes or less for most users. No module require the use of tools for assembly, but a small amount of super glue or a similar cyanoacrylate glue is recommended for the Base Module.
### Scale Tray Installation
1. Remove the factory scale weighing tray from your A&D balance, or whatever other weighing tray may currently be installed, and ensure the top of the scale is free of any loose powder kernels or other debris
2. Place the Printed Precision Trickler's Scale Tray into the hole in the center on top of the A&D balance
   - NOTE: The Scale Tray is keyed and can be oriented in 4 different positions - the opening of the Tray Centering Ring on the top of the tray should face towards the front-right corner of the scale
### Base Module
1. Orient the Trickle/Bulk Module Mount such that the small funnel is pointing up and the two square cutouts are angling away from the opening in the Stand With Integrated Windbreak
   - ***(OPTIONAL)*** Apply a small amount of super glue or other CA glue to the top edge of the Stand, but not to the tips of the 3 "fingers" that protrude from the top edge ***(OPTIONAL)***
2. Ensuring the 3 protruding fingers on the top of the Stand line up with the 3 cutouts in the bottom of the Module Mount, place the Module Mount down onto the top of the Stand
3. Once aligned, press firmly to ensure that the Module Mount is fully-seated and level with the top of the Stand
   - If CA glue was applied to the top of the Stand, hold the Module Mount in position for 15-45 seconds until the glue sets
4. Place the Base Module onto your scale within the raised ring, such that the windbreak opening is facing the front-right corner of the scale
   - The two tabs on the ring at the base will fit into the openings on the left and right of the raised ring on top of the scale
### Trickle Dispense Module
1. Select which Trickler Disk you would like to use
   - The Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Varget") is ideal for most non-magnum rifle powders and is the recommended starting point when utilizing the Printed Precision Trickler with any new powder you have not used before
   - The Large Powder Trickler Disk (marked "Retubbo") is ideal and necessary for some magnum rifle powders, such as Retumbo and N570, with exceptionally large kernels that do not fit into the slots of the Small/Average Powder Trickler Disk
2. Hold the Trickler Disk within the top portion of the Trickler Cup, oriented so that the flat surface of the disk is facing down
3. Rotate the Trickler Disk until the flat edge within the center through-hole lines up with the flat surface on the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
4. Grasping the center knob, press the Trickler Disk down onto the keyed motor shaft inside of the Trickler Cup
5. Release the center knob, and press down on the flat top surface of the disk using your thumbs on opposite sides of the center knob (as close to the middle as possible) to ensure that the Trickler Disk has been fully inserted
### Bulk Dispense Module
1. Install the Bulk Disk using the same technique as installation of a trickler disk, first lining up the keyed motor shaft with the through-hole on the disk before pressing it into place using the center knob and your thumbs on opposite sides of the flat top surface
2. Rotate the Bulk Cup until the larger opening in the sidewall is facing towards you
3. Place the Bulk Funnel on top of the disk, with the hopper portion away from you and pointing up. The bar extending from the bottom of the hopper will protrude through the opening in the Bulk Cup side wall towards you at this point in time
4. Line up the tab on the far side of the Bulk Funnel with the small hole in the far sidewall of the Bulk Cup, and press firmly to insert the tab into the hole
5. Once the far tab has been inserted, keep forwards pressure while sliding the near-side tab to your right into the horizontal slot in the Bulk Cup sidewall
6. Once both tabs have been inserted into their respective slots, pull the hopper back towards you slightly to ensure it is firmly pressed against the surface of the Bulk Cup's sidewall near the large opening
7. If the red rubber Hopper Gasket is not positioned within the retaining groove at the top of the installed Bulk Funnel, replace it back into the top groove at this time
### Final Assembly
1. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Trickle Dispense Module into the left square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Trickler Module has a hole in the bottom near the edge that kernels will drop through, this hole must face the center funnel of the Module Mount
2. With the Base Module in place on top of the scale, lower the Bulk Dispense Module into the right square opening of the Module Mount
   - NOTE: The Bulk Dispense Module has a tighter fit than the Trickle Dispense Module due to the additional weight of a full powder hopper
3. Insert the Powder Hopper into the top of the Bulk Funnel, where it will have a snug fit inside of the Hopper Gasket, until it reaches a hard stop and can be inserted no further
4. Place the Powder Hopper Cap over the top of the Powder Hopper
### Plugging Everything In
1. Plug the end of the Bulk cable into the motor of your Bulk Dispense Module
   - The connector may only be inserted in one direction, with the alignment tabs facing up
2. Plug the end of the Trickle cable into the motor of your Trickle Dispense Module
3. Plug one end of the provided RS-232 cable into the matching port on the right side of your trickler Control Unit as well as the rear of your fx-series scale
4. Plug the included power adapter into both the wall and the barrel jack on the right side of your trickler Control Unit
   - ***CAUTION*** To avoid spilled powder from the startup calibration cycle, double-check that the enable toggle, the middle button on the control unit, is not depressed when plugging in the power cable for the first time
### Scale Configuration
Settings that require configuration and the configured values:
- bA5Fnc-Cond = 0
- bA5Fnc-SPd = 2
- dout-Prt = 4
- SiF-bP5 = 5
- SiF-btPr = 2
- SiF-Crlf = 1
- SiF-tYPE = 4
- Unit = GN

When programming your scale, you will use the following 4 buttons on the front face of the scale:
- SAMPLE
  - Press and hold for 2 seconds to enter the configuration menu
  - Used to scroll between categories and individual settings
- RE-ZERO/TARE
  - Changes the currently displayed setting
- PRINT
  - Selects a currently-displayed category to view individual settings within that category
  - Saves a currently-displayed individual setting
- CAL
  - Exits the configuration menu

### Detailed Scale Programming Instructions
For those who have a standard/unlocked fx-series scale, denoted by the presence of an orange "Re-Zero" key on the front panel of the scale, the following steps are all that is needed to program your scale for use with the Printed Precision Trickler. For those with an NTEP scale, denoted by model names ending with "N" and an orange "Tare" key on the front panel, you must first follow steps further below to unlock your scale so that the configuration may be altered.

1. User action --> Display after action is completed

The format of these instructions are as noted above, where the action you need to take is immediately followed by what you should see on the display once the action has been completed.

1. Press and hold SAMPLE for 2 seconds --> bA5Fnc
2. Press PRINT --> Cond
3. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 2 times, or until 0 is displayed --> Cond 0
4. Press SAMPLE 4 times --> 5Pd
5. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 2 times, or until 2 is displayed --> 5Pd 2
6. Press PRINT --> CP Fnc
7. Press SAMPLE 3 times --> dout
8. Press PRINT --> Prt
9. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 4 times, or until 4 is displayed --> Prt 4
10. Press PRINT --> 5iF
11. Press PRINT --> bp5
12. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 3 times, or until 5 is displayed --> bp5 5
13. Press SAMPLE --> btPr
14. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 2 times, or until 2 is displayed --> btPr 2 (8-N will display above btPr)
15. Press SAMPLE --> CrLF
16. Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> CrLF 1
17. Press SAMPLE --> tyPE
18. Press RE-ZERO/TARE 4 times, or until 4 is displayed --> tyPE 4 (NU will display above tyPE)
19. Press PRINT --> Unit
20. Press PRINT --> Unit g
21. Press SAMPLE 10 times, or until GN appears --> Unit GN
    - If GN does not appear as an option when cycling through all individual settings, exit the configuration menu by pressing CAL, turn the scale off, and proceed to the Konami Code Unit Selection instructions below
22. Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit GN (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grains has been selected as your default unit of measurement)
23. Press PRINT --> id
24. Press CAL --> Exits configuration menu

Your scale should now be fully configured to operate with your Printed Precision Trickler!

### Konami Code Unit Selection
Unfortunately some scales will arrive without having Grains available to select as your unit of measure, which is usually the result of the scale being an NTEP model rather than a factory unlocked scale. This requires a more complicated method to enable Grains as an option before it may be selected in the standard configuration menu as described above.

***IMPORTANT NOTE*** - Step 4 has a very short window of time in which it must be completed, so please make sure to read steps 3-5 in full prior to completing step 3 to avoid needing to restart the process

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Read steps 3-5 to be sure you understand them prior to continuing
3. Hold PRINT and RE-ZERO/TARE while turning the scale on --> The screen will light up
4. ***While still holding RE-ZERO/TARE***, release the PRINT key and then rapidly press PRINT 2 times --> The screen will go empty
5. Hold RE-ZERO/TARE and press PRINT --> Unit g
   - If you don't see unit after pressing PRINT the first time, press PRINT a 2nd time because some scales (depending on exact factory configuration) will require 2 presses of it to proceed here
6. Press SAMPLE until GN is displayed --> Unit GN
7. Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit GN (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grains has been enabled as a unit of measurement)
8. ***OPTIONAL*** Press SAMPLE until g is displayed --> Unit g
9. ***OPTIONAL*** Press RE-ZERO/TARE --> *Unit g (A circle will appear to the left of Unit, indicating Grams has been enabled as a unit of measurement)
10. Press PRINT --> END will display, followed by another menu item (exact menu item depends on the individual scale)
11. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the Detailed Scale Programming Instructions above

### NTEP Scale Unlocking
For people with NTEP scales, denoting by model names ending with "N" and an orange "Tare" key on the front panel instead of the orange "RE-ZERO" key that unlocked models have, the following steps must be taken BEFORE you can properly configure your scale to work with the Printed Precision Trickler.

NOTE: Your NTEP scale may also have arrived to you with a metal plate attached to the back of the outer housing, directly underneath the RS-232 port. To be able to press the "Internal Cal" button in these instructions you must first remove this plate as it covers the opening through which that button is accessed.

***Internal Cal*** -- This button is located within the outer housing of the scale, accessed by reaching through the hole below the RS-232 port in the back of the housing. It is along the rear edge of the scale housing at the very top, and can usually be felt simply by inserting a finger into the opening and bending your knuckle until you feel the circuit board mounted to the top of the housing.

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Press and hold both Internal Cal and CAL buttons while turning the scale on --> The entire display will light up at once (you can release the Internal Cal and CAL buttons once you see this)
3. Hold SAMPLE and press PRINT 2 times --> APr
   - If you see something other than APr, press SAMPLE until APr is displayed
   - If APr is not available when cycling through all menu options with the SAMPLE key, turn the scale off and follow Advanced NTEP Unlock instructions further below
4. Press PRINT --> APr
5. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> APr 0 (STD will display above APr)
6. Press PRINT --> End will display
7. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the Konami Code Unit Selection instructions above

### Advanced NTEP Unlock
Due to the large number of possible configurations for an fx-series scale from the factory, you may find yourself unfortunately stymied when trying to locate the APr menu to unlock your NTEP scale. Don't worry, this doesn't mean your scale is broken or unusable! It simply means your scale's default configuration is slightly different from most NTEP scales and requires an extra step to enable the APr menu from the NTEP Scale Unlocking instructions.

1. Begin with your scale plugged in, but turned off --> Small arrow in the bottom left corner
2. Press and hold both Internal Cal and CAL buttons while turning the scale on --> The entire display will light up at once (you can release the Internal Cal and CAL buttons once you see this)
3. Hold TARE and press PRINT --> Unit
4. Press SAMPLE until Ld is displayed --> Ld
5. Press PRINT --> Ld # (# will be some number, it varies from scale to scale)
6. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> Ld 0
7. Press PRINT --> End will display, followed by another menu item (exact menu item depends on the individual scale)
   - If Ani is displayed, skip step 8
8. Press SAMPLE until Ani is displayed --> Ani
9. Press PRINT --> Ani # (# will be some number, it varies from scale to scale)
10. Press TARE until 0 is displayed --> Ani 0
11. Press PRINT --> End will display, followed by another menu item
12. Press ON:OFF to turn the scale off, proceed to the NTEP Scale Unlocking instructions above

## Normal Usage

## Emptying After Use

## Troubleshooting

## Software Updates
To update the software on your Printed Precision Trickler, you will need the following items:
- Windows, MacOS, or Linux computer
- MicroUSB cable

The steps below will be provided from the perspective of a user with a computer running the Windows operating system, but the steps are largely similar across all operating systems.

### Install Arduino IDE and the Arduino AVR Board Package
Those who have used an Arduino before in the past may already have these steps completed, but for those new to Arduinos here are the steps to follow on a Windows computer:
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE from the Arduino website here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software
   - You may select whatever options you like during the installation procedure, it will not affect your ability to update the software on your trickler
2. Launch the newly-installed program
3. In the far-left column of the Arduino IDE, select the icon that is 2nd from the top named "Board Manager"
4. Search for or scroll to locate the "Arduino AVR Boards" item in the list of options, and click "INSTALL"
   - You may see a prompt requesting permission to make changes, this is to install the drivers that will allow your computer to communicate with the Arduino Nano

### Download, Extract, and Open the Latest Printed Precision Trickler Software Release
1. On the GitHub page where this user manual is located (https://github.com/PrintedPrecision/Printed-Precision-Trickler), click the "Releases" text on the right-hand side of the screen to show all software releases
   - Alternatively, you may click the release tag name immediately below the "Releases" text to navigate directly to the latest release
2. Locate the software release version you wish to install and click one of the options below the description to download a compressed archive of the source code for that software release
   - For those using Windows PC's, the zip version is highly recommended
3. Open the file explorer and navigate to your downloads folder where the compressed archive is saved
4. Extract the source code from the compressed archive
   - Note that the location you extract the files to is unimportant
5. Once the compressed archive has finished extracting, navigate into the folders until you see a list of 10 files - inclduding this User Manual!
6. In the folder where all 10 files are visible, create a new folder named "PrintedPrecisionTrickler"
   - Arduino IDE requires that the main project file (the one with the .ino file extension) be located within a folder of the same name as the project file
7. Drag and drop all 10 of the files into your newly created folder, before entering this folder to once again view the full list of 10 files
8. Double-click the file named "PrintedPrecisionTrickler.ino" to open the project file in your installed Arduino IDE

### Install the Additional Libraries
1. In the far-left column of the Arduino IDE, select the icon that is 3rd from the top named "Library Manager"
2. Type "MobaTools" into the search bar and locate the library of the same name in the list of results published by "MicroBahner" - click "INSTALL"
   - This is the library to control the stepper motors, with the latest version being 2.6.2 at the time of this writing
   - You will notice that the description for this library is written in German, but don't worry! You will not need to know any foreign languages to complete your software update.
3. Type "hd44780" into the search bar and locate the library of the same name in the list of results published by "Bill Perry" - click "INSTALL"
   - This is the library to control the display, with the latest version being 1.3.2 at the time of this writing

### Connect Your Trickler and Update the Software
Now that all of our preparations are complete, we are finally ready to update the software on your Printed Precision Trickler!
1. Disconnect your Printed Precision Trickler from both your scale and the power supply that was included with your trickler
2. Plug one end of your MicroUSB cable to an available USB port on your computer
3. Plug the other end of your MicroUSB cable into the port located within the opening on the left side panel of your trickler control unit
   - Note that this only plugs in one direction! The widest edge of the MicroUSB's trapezoidal shape should face up.
   - Your computer may prompt you for permission to install a device driver at this point, click to allow this driver to be installed if this happens for you
4. In the top left corner of the Arduino IDE you will see a drop down selection menu, click on this and then click on the option named "Arduino Nano Every"
   - Underneath the "Arduino Nano Every" descripter will be a "COM5" or similar phrase, this is normal and just indicates the name of the port your Arduino is plugged into and is not important (it will be different for different computers)
5. Locate the Upload button to the left of this drop-down menu
   - It looks like an arrow pointing sideways, and is the 2nd icon from the left in the top tray that also contains the Verify button (a checkmark) and the Arduino selection drop-down menu
6. Click the Upload button to update the software of your trickler
   - This process will take approximately 10-15 seconds
   - You will see a progress menu in the bottom right corner - ***DO NOT UNPLUG THE MICRO USB CABLE UNTIL AFTER IT CHANGES TO SAY "DONE UPLOADING"***
   - You will likely see red error text pop up in the "Output" window on the lower half of the screen, this is expected and does not cause any issues (you can read more about this on the [Arduino support website](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4405239282578-If-you-see-a-jtagmkII-initialize-Cannot-locate-flash-and-boot-memories-in-description-message-when-uploading-to-Nano-Every) if you would like)

At this point the software on your Printed Precision Trickler has been updated! You may confirm that your trickler software has been updated by making sure that the version number displayed on the screen is the same as the release version that you downloaded, and you may freely disconnect the MicroUSB cable at this time.
